"""Atomic I/O utilities for the data lake.

All writes go to a sibling temp file, are fsync'd, then atomically renamed into
place so readers never observe a partial file.

Advisory file locking:
    ``FileLock`` provides cross-process advisory locks via ``fcntl.flock``
    on POSIX. Use this to prevent concurrent writers from clobbering each
    other's data during read-modify-write cycles.
