"""End-to-end parity tests for Dhan live market feed and depth.

Closes Plan §5.1 + §6 silent-failure gaps by asserting that real Dhan
WebSocket traffic produces ticks and depth entries that match the
expected canonical shape, within a deadline.

Two-gate design
---------------
These tests only run when BOTH conditions hold:

1. ``.env.local`` exists at the repo root with ``DHAN_CLIENT_ID`` and
   ``DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN``. This is the standard pattern already used by
   ``brokers/dhan/tests/integration/test_live_websocket.py``.
2. ``PRE_PROD_GATE=1`` is exported. CI on developer machines runs the
   cheaper offline unit + golden tests; only the pre-prod pipeline runs
   these against the live Dhan session. The intent is that any failure
   here blocks a release, while developers are not slowed down by 09:15
   IST pre-market timeouts on every pytest invocation.

When the market is closed (weekends / outside 09:15-15:30 IST) tests are
*skipped with a clear reason*, not silently passed — that was the bug
called out in §5.7.

Coverage
--------
- LTP / Quote / Full ticks for NIFTY (IDX_I)
- Quote ticks for RELIANCE (NSE_EQ)
- Full ticks for an NIFTY option (NSE_FNO)
- Depth-20 for NIFTY: ≥ 5 levels on each side within a deadline
- Depth-200 for RELIANCE: ≥ 50 levels on each side within a deadline

# Note on `requires_pre_prod_or_off`
# --------------------------------
# An earlier draft of this module defined a second marker that skipped
# only on missing credentials (so it would also run on a developer
# machine during off-market hours). The two markers ended up identical
# because every test in this module also calls ``_skip_if_off_market``
# — a developer-machine tick-parity test without a live Dhan session
# would deadlock on a 10s ``received.wait()`` and waste CI cycles. The
# marker is removed; if a future off-market smoke test is needed, add
# it with a new name and a deliberate skip predicate.
