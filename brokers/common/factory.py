"""BrokerProviderFactory — abstract interface for broker factory implementations.

Both BrokerFactory (Dhan) and UpstoxBrokerFactory should implement this
interface so BrokerService can call either factory polymorphically.

.. note::
    This factory returns ``MarketDataGateway`` (the legacy ABC). To use the
    new ``CommonBrokerGateway`` Protocol, wrap the result with
    ``brokers.common.adapters.wrap_market_gateway()``.  See
    ``brokers.common.bootstrap`` for the full wiring sequence.
