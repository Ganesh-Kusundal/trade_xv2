"""Hardened SSL/TLS helpers for outbound broker HTTP (REF-38).

Why this module exists
----------------------
A bare :class:`requests.Session` uses ``certifi`` for certificate
verification, which is correct but easy to weaken silently. Anyone
who later passes ``verify=False`` to debug a connection issue
creates a permanent credential-eavesdropping risk on every call
site, not just the broken one.

This module centralises the policy:

- :func:`create_pinned_session` returns a :class:`requests.Session`
  whose transport adapter is built with a deliberately hardened
  :class:`ssl.SSLContext` (TLS 1.2+ only, no weak ciphers, hostname
  checking on). The context is the *default* for every connection
  this session makes, so accidental ``verify=False`` on a single
  call still fails fast.

- :func:`hardened_ssl_context` returns the same context so callers
  using :mod:`urllib3` directly, or :mod:`httpx`, can adopt it.

- :func:`assert_secure_session` is a guard: it inspects an existing
  session and raises if it has been misconfigured. Run this in
  production-readiness checks and CLI startup.

The defaults here are deliberately conservative. They follow the
Mozilla "Intermediate" profile:

- ``TLSv1.2`` minimum (TLS 1.0 and 1.1 disabled)
- Strong cipher list (no RC4, 3DES, NULL, MD5, EXPORT)
- Hostname checking on
- ``OP_NO_COMPRESSION`` to mitigate CRIME

Not done here
-------------
Certificate pinning (public-key or SPKI) is intentionally NOT
implemented in this first cut. Pinning requires the SHA-256 of
each broker's leaf or intermediate key, which changes on every
rotation. We rely on the system trust store for now. A future
revision can layer pinning on top of this helper.
