"""Production Readiness Checker.

Implements M-7: a strict, no-bypass pre-flight validator that runs at
BrokerService init time. The CLI **must** fail to start a live path if:

  * Reconciliation is not wired
  * EventLog is not wired
  * WebSocket services are not registered with the lifecycle
  * RiskManager is not configured (capital_fn returns 0 with no override)
  * Required credentials are missing
  * Health checks fail

The checker is invoked from BrokerService._ensure_initialized. Failures
are returned as a list of (check_name, message) tuples so the CLI can
print a structured "unsafe to deploy" report.

Why: per the production certification review, the system must refuse to
start an unsafe configuration rather than silently degrading. Every
prior production failure class started as a "looks fine at boot, breaks
under load" defect; this guard closes that pattern at the boundary.
