"""End-to-end regression tests for the OMS path.

This file is the canonical home for "would a real production failure
slip through?" tests. Each test maps to a named incident or to an
invariant the production certification report explicitly called out
(DH-906, kill switch, trade idempotency, lifecycle drain order).

Tests:

* ``test_place_order_kill_switch_under_contention`` — 4 threads
  attempt ``place_order`` concurrently while the kill switch is on.
  All 4 must be rejected with the canonical reason.

* ``test_dhan_place_order_with_read_cb_open_still_posts_order`` —
  direct regression for DH-906: an OPEN read circuit breaker must
  not block ``POST /orders``. The CB split (Phase A / A1) was the
  fix; this test pins the invariant.

* ``test_record_trade_unknown_order_does_not_mark_ledger`` — a
  trade for an unknown order must return False and must NOT mark
  the ledger, so a later ORDER_UPDATED delivery can retry it.
  Calling ``record_trade`` with the same trade a second time must
  still return False (the ledger is not poisoned on first sight).

* ``test_oms_drains_in_reverse_registration_order`` — a lifecycle
  with 3 services must stop them in reverse-registration order.
