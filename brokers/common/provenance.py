"""ProvenanceLedger — audit record for multi-source historical data merges.

Every federated historical fetch produces a ``ProvenanceLedger`` that answers:
- Which chunks were assigned to which broker?
- Which bar index ranges came from which source?
- Were there any conflicts, and how were they resolved?
- Is the series degraded (partial data)?

This ledger is the audit trail required by the zero-parity rule: backtest,
replay, and live must consume data with identical provenance semantics.
