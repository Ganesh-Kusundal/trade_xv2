"""Tests for the UpstoxBroker bundle-split (REF-23).

The constructor refactor extracted client/adapter/order-path
construction into three private helpers. The PUBLIC attribute set
on :class:`UpstoxBroker` MUST be unchanged — every attribute that
external callers reach for (``market_data``, ``order_command``,
``portfolio``, ...) is still present after the split.

This test loads the broker class, instantiates a stub settings
object, and asserts the attribute set matches a frozen
expectation. If a future refactor removes or renames an attribute
that external callers depend on, this test fails loudly.
