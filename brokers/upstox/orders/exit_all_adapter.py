    Delegates to the Upstox kill-switch client, which deactivates
    all trading segments in a single call.  Upstox does not have a
    dedicated ``/exitall`` endpoint (unlike Dhan), so segment-wide
    deactivation is the closest equivalent.

    from the Dhan ExitAllAdapter (``success``, ``positions_closed``,
