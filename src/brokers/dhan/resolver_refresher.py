"""ResolverRefresher — scheduled background service for the instrument master.

The :class:`brokers.dhan.resolver.SymbolResolver` is loaded once at
gateway construction. The compact CSV and the MCX supplement are then
frozen for the lifetime of the process. In a long-running process this
leads to two real problems:

1. **Stale security_ids** — Dhan re-lists option series weekly. If the
   process was started on Sunday night, a new weekly series listed on
   Monday morning will not appear in the resolver until restart. Calls
   to ``place_order`` for those series will fail with ``DH-906`` or
   the resolver will silently substitute an expired contract.

2. **Schema drift** — Dhan occasionally adds new columns to the master
   CSV. Without a periodic refresh, the resolver falls behind silently.

The :class:`ResolverRefresher` is a :class:`brokers.common.lifecycle.ManagedService`
that re-runs :meth:`brokers.dhan.connection.DhanConnection.load_instruments`
on a configurable interval, atomic-swaps the new resolver, and emits a
``resolver_refreshed`` audit event. Failures are recorded in the
health snapshot but never block the main trading path — a transient
network failure should not take down order placement.

Behaviour
---------
* The refresh runs in a daemon thread, so a slow network or a large
  CSV does not block the order-placement hot path.
* The new resolver is built completely in memory and then atomic-swapped
  into :class:`DhanConnection` so readers either see the old or the
  new resolver, never a half-loaded one.
* Refresh count and last error are exposed via ``health()`` for the SRE
  layer.
* The interval is configurable; the default is once a day at 00:30 UTC
  (post-token-expiry). For tests the interval can be set to a small
  value to verify the loop fires.

Why this is a separate module
-----------------------------
It is owned by a :class:`LifecycleManager` so the process can drain it
deterministically on shutdown. The previous "fire and forget" pattern
left daemon threads leaked on process exit.

    """Background scheduler that periodically refreshes the instrument resolver.

    Usage::

        refresher = ResolverRefresher(
            connection=conn,
            interval_seconds=24 * 3600,
        )

    Parameters
    ----------
    connection:
        The :class:`DhanConnection` whose resolver should be refreshed.
    interval_seconds:
        How often the refresh should fire. The default is once per day
        (86400 seconds). For unit tests a few seconds is appropriate.
    on_success:
        Optional callable invoked after a successful refresh with the
        new instrument count. Useful for dashboards / metrics.
    on_error:
        Optional callable invoked with the exception after a failed
        refresh. Useful for alerting.
