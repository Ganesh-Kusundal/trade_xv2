"""Dhan identity provider — single source of truth for symbol→security_id.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Every adapter that talks to Dhan must produce a payload containing a
``securityId`` (string) and an ``exchangeSegment`` (one of the Dhan segment
codes). Historically every adapter called
``self._resolver.resolve(symbol, exchange)`` and then computed the segment
from ``EXCHANGE_TO_SEGMENT.get(...)`` independently. That worked but it had
three problems:

1. A caller could in principle bypass the resolver and ship any number as a
   ``securityId`` — there was no type-level guarantee that what reached the
   HTTP body came from a Dhan-controlled source.
2. The Upstox / Dhan boundary was implicit. The Dhan resolver happens to be
   the only place that produces Dhan-internal security IDs, but nothing
   prevented a future change from accidentally feeding Upstox data into it.
3. Audit trail: when a security_id is shipped to Dhan, we had no structured
   log of *which* row in *which* source produced it (CSV vs MCX JSON vs the
   hardcoded index table).

This module fixes all three by:

* Owning the ``SymbolResolver`` and the ``indices.py`` hardcoded
  table behind a single ``DhanIdentityProvider`` factory.
* Wrapping every successful resolution in an immutable ``DhanInstrumentRef``
  that structurally cannot carry an Upstox identifier (the
  ``exchange_segment`` field is a literal from Dhan's own set, enforced at
  construction).
* Emitting a structured ``security_id_issued`` audit event with the
  ``source`` field ("csv" / "mcx_json" / "hardcoded_index").
* Exposing one ``resolve_ref(symbol, exchange, *, expected_segment=None)``
  method that the adapters call. The optional ``expected_segment`` argument
  (PR-C) lets the caller disambiguate between an index spot LTP query and
  a derivatives query for the same underlying.

Anything in ``brokers/dhan/**`` that builds an outgoing Dhan HTTP payload
**must** import from this module — *not* from ``brokers/dhan/resolver.py``
directly. The DhanIdentityProvider is the only legal path to a
``DhanInstrumentRef``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    symbol:
        The user-facing trading symbol as resolved.
    exchange:
        Dhan's :class:`Exchange` enum value (NSE / BSE / NFO / BFO / MCX /
        CDS / INDEX). A plain string with the same value is also accepted
        for ergonomic call sites; the carrier normalises to the enum.
    exchange_segment:
        Dhan segment code (one of :data:`DHAN_SEGMENTS`). Always a string
        from the Dhan set; never an Upstox instrument_key.
    security_id:
        Dhan's exchange standard security ID (string of digits). Either
        from the master CSV, the MCX JSON supplement, or the hardcoded
        index table.
    instrument_type:
        Dhan :class:`InstrumentType` classification. Optional for callers
        that don't need it; ``resolve_ref`` populates this from the
        resolver.
    lot_size:
        Lot size in number of shares/contracts. Defaults to 1 for spot
        instruments.
    is_synthetic_index:
        True when the ref was constructed from
        :mod:`config.indices` (the hardcoded NIFTY=13 / BANKNIFTY=25
        table). Useful for callers that want to refuse derivative-style
        operations on a synthetic spot ref.
    source:
        :class:`DhanIdentitySource` value, recorded for audit. Defaults to
        ``CSV`` when callers construct the ref directly.
    underlying:
        Underlying root symbol for F&O contracts (e.g. ``"NIFTY"`` for a
        NIFTY option). None for cash / index spot.
    expiry:
        ISO date string for derivatives, else None.
    strike_price:
        Strike price for options, else None.
