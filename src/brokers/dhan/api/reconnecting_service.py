"""Shared lifecycle / reconnect / callback machinery for Dhan WS services.

Plan §7.2 + §8: ``DhanMarketFeed``, ``PollingMarketFeed`` and the unified
``BinaryDepthFeed`` (depth-20 / depth-200) each implemented their own
reconnect loop, backoff, ``_last_message_at`` tracking, and callback
list helpers. This module collects that machinery into one place so a
future change to "reconnect behaviour" is a single edit, not shotgun
surgery across five classes.

What the mixin owns
-------------------
- ``_stop_event``           — interruptible thread-stop coordination
- ``_is_connected``         — best-effort connection flag
- ``_reconnect_count``      — total reconnect cycles
- ``_last_message_at``      — UTC timestamp of last received message
- ``_message_count``        — running total of received messages
- ``_callback_lock``        — guard for ``*_callbacks`` lists
- backoff arithmetic        — 1.0 → 30.0 s with reset on clean exit
- correlation-id generation  — monotonic per-process counter

What the mixin does NOT own
---------------------------
- The actual ``threading.Thread`` lifecycle (start/stop/join). That
  varies per service (``DhanMarketFeed`` uses an SDK feed, the binary
  depth feed uses raw ``websockets``, ``PollingMarketFeed`` runs an
  in-process sleep loop) and stays in each subclass.
- Domain-specific ``*_callbacks`` lists. Subclasses still own their
  own callback attribute but register through ``_register_callback``
  so the lock and the snapshotting discipline are uniform.
- Health snapshot construction. Subclasses still build their own
  :class:`HealthStatus` because the metrics they expose differ.
