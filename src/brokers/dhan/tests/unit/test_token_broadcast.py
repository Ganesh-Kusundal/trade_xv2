"""REF-13: token-broadcast / receiver-list contract tests.

The previous design only refreshed the HTTP client and the market
feed on token rotation. Order stream and depth feeds kept the stale
token until their next reconnect, which was the documented DH-906
incident failure mode. This module verifies the new
``register_token_receiver`` / ``broadcast_token`` contract:

* any callable accepting a single string is accepted as a receiver,
* registration is idempotent,
* broadcast isolates per-receiver failures,
* a registered receiver is called for every broadcast.

These tests do not use a real Dhan connection; they drive the
public surface of :class:`DhanConnection` so they pass without
network access and remain stable across refactors.
