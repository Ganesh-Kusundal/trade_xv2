"""Shared async/sync boundary helpers.

When synchronous Python code needs to drive an async coroutine (e.g.
WebSocket connect/disconnect), there are two cases:

1. **Async context** — an event loop is already running.  The coroutine is
   scheduled via ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` which is safe from any
   thread (not just the event-loop thread).
2. **Sync context** — no event loop.  A temporary loop is created, the
   coroutine is awaited, and the loop is torn down.

Thread safety
-------------
``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` is always used in the async-context path
because the caller may be on a different thread (e.g. a CLI command
calling ``gateway.stream()`` while the Textual TUI owns the event
loop).  ``asyncio.ensure_future`` would fail with
``RuntimeError: Task attached to a different loop`` when called from
a non-loop thread.
