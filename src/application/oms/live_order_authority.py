"""Single live-order authority (drift D2 remediation).

Every order-placing surface — normal orders, super/forever/exit-all extended
orders, the FastAPI live router, and the Textual CLI — MUST call
:func:`authorize_live_order` before any broker executor touches the wire.

Before this module existed, the ``allow_live_orders`` flag was checked only
inside individual leaf adapters (``OrderPlacer``, ``UpstoxOrderGateway``), so
the extended-order executors (super/forever/exit-all) and the API
``require_live_broker`` dependency reached the broker with no such check. This
module lifts the gate to one composition-root-enforced authority so a new order
path cannot silently inherit "no guard".

Checks run fail-closed in this order:

1. **Live-actionable gate** — the composition-root-registered readiness gate
   (``brokers.services._session.check_live_actionable`` / ``_LiveGateState``).
   Injectable via ``live_actionable`` for testing; when omitted, the
   module-global gate is consulted, which blocks live brokers if unset.
2. **allow_live_orders flag** — the env/profile switch
   (``config/profiles/*.allow_live_orders_by_default``). Off => blocked for
   live brokers.
3. **Kill switch** — via the risk manager.
4. **Full pre-trade risk path** — an order whose payload cannot be modelled into
   a domain ``Order`` is a REJECTION, never a silent pass (this was the D2
   ``ExtendedOrderService._check_risk`` bug, which returned ``None`` on coercion
   failure and let the order through).
