"""Unit and chaos tests for Dhan WebSocket reconnection hardening (H2 Critical Fix).

Tests verify:
1. Max reconnect attempts stops feed after configurable limit
2. Staleness detection warns when feed hasn't received messages
3. Health endpoint exposes reconnect metrics
4. Reconnect counter resets on successful connection
