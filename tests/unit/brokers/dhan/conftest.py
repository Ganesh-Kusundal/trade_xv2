"""Unit test conftest — shared fixtures for the Dhan unit test suite.

Key fixture: ``noop_admission`` (autouse, session scope)
    Patches ``MarketFeedConnectionAdmission`` with ``NoopAdmission`` for
    every unit test so that:
    - No ``fcntl`` lock files are created or contested.
    - No cooldown JSON files are written to the ``runtime/`` directory.
    - Tests that construct ``DhanMarketFeed`` directly never race on the
      host-wide admission lock when run in parallel.

    The real ``MarketFeedConnectionAdmission`` is tested separately in
    ``test_connection_admission.py`` (if present) with its own lock path.
