"""REF-31: pickle-loader security tests.

The previous :meth:`InstrumentLoader._migrate_pickle_to_json` used
``pickle.load`` on a file in the cache directory. That was a CWE-502
arbitrary-code-execution vulnerability: an attacker who can write to
the cache directory (compromised CI, malicious dependency, shared
container) could achieve code execution in the trading process.

The contract this module enforces is:

1. The loader MUST NOT call :func:`pickle.load` on any file in the
   cache directory.
2. A legacy ``.pkl`` file MUST be quarantined (renamed to
   ``.pkl.quarantine``) so the loader can no longer pick it up.
3. If the quarantine rename fails, the loader MUST continue to
   operate by rebuilding from the authoritative JSON source.

These tests construct a real ``.pkl`` file in a temporary directory
and verify the loader never invokes ``pickle.load`` on it.
