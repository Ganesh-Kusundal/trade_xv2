"""Task 4.4: Lock-sharding verification and throughput benchmark.

Validates:
1. Thread-safety: concurrent publishes produce unique, monotonic sequence numbers.
2. Correctness: all handlers receive all events under concurrent publish.
3. Throughput: concurrent publish rate improves vs single-lock baseline.
