"""Request-scoped dependency management using contextvars.

Provides per-request lifetime management for services registered
with scope='request'. Each request_scope() context manager creates
a new scope, and services within that scope are created once and
shared across all resolutions within the same request.

Usage:
    from infrastructure.di_scopes import request_scope

    async def handle_request():
        async with request_scope():
            # Services resolved here are request-scoped
            svc1 = container.resolve("my_service")
            svc2 = container.resolve("my_service")
            assert svc1 is svc2  # Same instance within request

    # Outside request_scope(), request-scoped services raise errors
