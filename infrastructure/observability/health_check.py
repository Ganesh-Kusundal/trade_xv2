"""Broker health checks for the centralized infrastructure health registry.

Registers per-broker connectivity and WebSocket health checks with the
``infrastructure.health.health_registry`` singleton so the SRE layer can
poll a single endpoint for system-wide health.

Usage (called automatically by broker factories)::

    from tradex.runtime.observability.health_check import register_broker_health_check

    register_broker_health_check("dhan", gateway)

The health check evaluates:

1. **REST API reachability** — via ``gateway.describe()``.
2. **WebSocket stream health** — via ``ObservabilityProvider.get_connection_status()``
   when the gateway implements the protocol.

Status mapping:

- ``HEALTHY``   — REST reachable and all WebSocket streams connected
                  (or no streams configured, e.g. analytics-only mode).
- ``DEGRADED``  — REST reachable, some but not all streams connected.
- ``UNHEALTHY`` — REST unreachable, or all WebSocket streams disconnected.

    The check is intentionally lightweight — it reads cached connection

    safe to invoke on every SRE poll interval.

    gateway:
